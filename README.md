# Lenovo-Charge-Threshold-BatchUI
Lenovo thinkpads chargethreshold.exe small UI

Lenovo thinkpads have a charge threshold utility which allow them to cut charge at a certain percentage to protect them from overcharge.

This is only accesible from lenovo vantage (normal or commercial) or the ChargeThreshold.exe

If you don't like vantage like me, you'll probably go to the EXE to use it, but the EXE only accepts console commands.
All this file does is humanize those console commands so they're nicer, faster and more understandable to use.

(ChargeThreshold.exe included)

Made with hate towards vantage <3
